# About

`personal-website-kotlinjs` is a cutting-edge Kotlin multiplatform project, powering [gchristov.com](https://gchristov.com). Built with [KotlinJS](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/js-overview.html), it seamlessly bridges Kotlin and Javascript to bring a fully serverless platform, currently deployed as microservice [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) containers on [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/run) using [Pulumi](https://www.pulumi.com/) infrastructure as code.

## Setup

The project can be run locally and deployed on the cloud - in our case to Google Cloud via Pulumi.

The below setup assumes you've already cloned the project locally.

<details>
  <summary>1Ô∏è‚É£ Google Cloud setup</summary>

1. Create a new Google Cloud project.
2. Create a Service Account for the infrastructure as code setup with the following roles:
    - `Artifact Registry Administrator`
    - `Service Account User`
    - `Service Usage Admin`
    - `Cloud Run Admin`
    - (Optional) If you're specifying a custom domain mapping, as we are, [verify domain ownership and add your service account as owner](https://search.google.com/search-console).
3. Export a JSON API key for your Service Account and call it `credentials-gcp-infra.json`.
4. [Signup and Install Pulumi](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/clouds/gcp/get-started/begin/#install-pulumi) locally.
5. Create a Pulumi [access token](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/pulumi-cloud/access-management/access-tokens/) and login locally using `pulumi login`.
6. The project uses Pulumi micro-stacks to deploy the microservices individually. Each microservice has a corresponding `infra` folder containing its `Pulumi.yaml` infrastructure program, eg `landing-page-web/infra`. To get the project going, you will need to manually initialise each microservice on GCP using the Pulumi scripts.
```
The order to do this matters, so go with common/infra first, then all other microservices, then proxy-web/infra. The reason is that the resouces are created incrementally at each stage and we currently have no way synchronize them.
```
7. The steps to deploy a microservice's infrastructure is the same for all:
    1. Navigate to its `infra` folder.
    2. Paste the `credentials-gcp-infra.json` file.
    3. Create a new empty Pulumi project with no resources using the `pulumi new` command and follow the instructions:
        - you can use the prompt `Empty project with no resources` for Pulumi AI;
        - you can use `prod` as your stack name;
    4. Replace the `name` in the microservice `Pulumi.yaml` with the value you entered in the prompt.
    5. Open `Pulumi.prod.yml` and replace the `gcp:project` value with your project id.
    6. Run `pulumi up` to automatically create the required microservice infrastructure.
    7. Repeat for the remaining microservices.

  <summary>2Ô∏è‚É£ Local setup</summary>

1. [Install Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/) and start it up. No additional configuration is required as the project uses Docker Compose to run locally. Checkout the `docker` folder for the setup.
2. [Install IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/installation-guide.html). This project has been tested with `IntelliJ IDEA 2023.2.5`.
3. Open the root project with IntelliJ and wait for it to initialise.
</details>

## Run locally

After completing the setup, you should be able to run the project locally using the `Personal-Website-Docker` IntelliJ IDE configuration. There is a landing page that should be available when you navigate to your [localhost](http://localhost:8080) url.

## CI and cloud deployment

This is really up to you! However, we've provided our setup below.

<details>
  <summary>GitHub Actions</summary>

The project is configured to build with [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) and have a separate workflow for each microservice. Checkout the `.github` folder for details. Follow these steps to configure the CI environment:

1. Add your Pulumi access token as a [GitHub encrypted secret](https://docs.github.com/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/creating-and-using-encrypted-secrets) with the name `PULUMI_ACCESS_TOKEN`.
2. Add an additional `GCP_SA_KEY_INFRA` GitHub encrypted secret, containing the raw JSON API key for the above infrastructure as code Service Account.
3. (Optional) Install the [Pulumi GitHub app](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/using-pulumi/continuous-delivery/github-app/) to get automated summaries of your infrastructure as code changes directly on your PR.

Once this is done:
- opening pull requests against the repo will trigger build/test checks as well as infrastructure changes preview for the microservice that has been changed;
- merging pull requests to the main branch deploys the changes to the corresponding microservice to Google Cloud;
